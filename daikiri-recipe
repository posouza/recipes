Ingredients
2 ounces rum -- white rum
1/2 teaspoon superfine sugar
1/2 ounce lime juice
cocktail glass

Instructions:
Squeeze the lime into your shaker, stir in the sugar, and then add the rum. Shake well with cracked ice, then strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Note on the rum: Some prefer dark over white; if you do use dark rum, cut back a little on the sugar.

The Wondrich Take:
In 1898, the U.S. Army forcibly removed the island of Cuba from the King of Spain. This was the Spanish-American War. What would Teddy Roosevelt, who was there with his Rough Riders, say if he knew that the "squalid little village" where his boys landed would give its name to a cocktail that lives on while the splendid little war that spawned it is all but forgotten?

As well it should. Esquire has lived through wars and drunk cocktails. We'll take the cocktails. Especially these. Remember the Maine!

(A note on origin: Many have claimed credit for the daiquiri -- Cuban barmen, American mining engineers, German princelings, what-have-you. But rum and the lime have a long history together. The British navy began administering lime juice to the ranks in 1795. Could it have been long before the swabbies started mixing it with their daily rum ration? And most Caribbean and South American peoples make liquor out of sugarcane, grow limes, and drink them together. What's the Brazilian caipirinha but a daiquiri on the rocks? In fact, the daiquiri represents such an obvious marriage between local ingredients -- rum, sugar, limes -- and American technology -- cocktail shaker, ice -- that it would take the chowder-headedest duffer who ever buttoned a trouser not to invent it.)
